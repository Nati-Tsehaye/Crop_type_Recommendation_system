# crop_type_recommendation_system

Crop Recommendation System is a powerful tool designed to provide tailored crop suggestions based on various environmental and soil parameters. By analyzing key factors such as Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K), temperature, humidity, pH levels, and rainfall, the system delivers precise recommendations to optimize crop selection and improve agricultural outcomes.

This system is integrated into a mobile app using Flutter, and the core crop recommendation model is powered by TensorFlow Lite (TFLite). This lightweight machine learning framework allows the app to perform on-device inference, ensuring efficient and quick recommendations without needing server-side processing. The app helps farmers and agricultural professionals make data-driven decisions for better crop yields and sustainability.

## Requirements

Python(tensorflow, pandas, numpy), Flutter
